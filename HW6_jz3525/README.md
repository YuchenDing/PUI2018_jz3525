### 1. Verify the Null and Alternate Hypothesis
I think it's really interesting to compare different types of customer. Personally, I've never thought about any possible difference on that. Very good point.
The only thing I have question about is the Null hypothesis and Alternate hypothesis states "biking on weekends" whereas the following project was made based on biking on weekdays. To make the project result clearer, I suggest to change the Null hypothesis to "The proportion of subsriber biking on weekdays is the same or higher than the proportion of customer biking on weekdays", and change the Alternative hypothesis to "The proportion of subscriber biking on weekdays is lower than the proportion of customer biking on weekdays".

### 2. Verify the Data Support the Project
As I mentioned above, the data calculated in the project doesn't match the Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis. If the two hypothesis were changed to statements based on biking on weekdays, the data match perfectly and were well pre-processed.
It's very well done to plot a normalized bar plot when the counts of two different types of users are significantly different to show the real difference.

### 3. Choose Appropriate Test
For the test, since the number of samples is really large (>30), I suggest conducting Z-test.
For this question, a Z-test could be applied with a one-tail two sample test, under 0.05 significance level, to show whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.


## Assignment 2
Group work with Asilayi Bahetibieke(ab8131), I did the ANOVA test and Correlation test while Asilayi finished the Logistic Regression test.

## Assignment 3
I worked with Asilayi to reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY and completed the Z-test and Chi-square test.

## Assignment 4
I worked with Asilayi to split the 201502 citibike dataset into trips during the day and night, and conducted three different tests (K-S test, Pearson's test and Spearman's test) to show whether there are statistical differences between the tripduration of them.
